## Portfolio

<p>I currently work at Wolfram Research since 2018 as a contracted casual UX consultant for user experience improvements on various products among different platforms (Desktop, Web, Mobile).
I work closely with designers and developers to ensure that user-centered design remains core of the project while research evidence supports design decisions.
Together with 2 years' academic training, I am proficient in user-centered design methods and mix-method analysis.
</p>

<p>
I believe technology should be effortless through user-centric design thinking.
