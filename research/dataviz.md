# Development of Novel Data Representations for Virtual Reality (VR) Exergames
[UWaterloo ITWIL Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/intelligent-technologies-wellness-independent-living/)| Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 | Role: Graduate Research Student (Master's Thesis)

## Project Description

Through the use of motion-based technologies (Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, etc.), exergames have the potential to collect quantified, objective, and complementary information about the exergaming sessions. However, limited research has explored how exergames can be used as tools to manage and administer exercise programs using the information collected in exergaming sessions. 

The objectives of this project are:
1. Explore metrics related to the performance of a person during an exergaming session using the developed [VR exergames](/research/vr).
2. Co-create data visualizations with exercise therapists to deliver meaningful information about an exergaming session or client status.
3. Evaluate the proposed data visualizations on its potential of complementing existing exercise therapy.

## Contribution
I design and lead the study (developing session scripts, moderate sessions), as well as data analysis process in this project.


## Outcomes
* A list of collectable information from VR equipment and their therapeutic meanings.
* Four data visualization concepts in representing player's performance and status.
* Evaluation and future directions of the four data visualization proposals.

## Process
The overall project is devided into three phases based on the objectives:
1. Identification of vital information collected from VR exergames to represent player's performance and fitness - _**informal interviews & ranking survey with semi-structured interviews**_.
2. Co-creation of data visualizations with collaborating exercise professionals - _**co-design workshops & semi-structured focus groups**_.
3. Evaluation of proposed data visualizations with general population of exercise professionals - _**online questionnaire**_.


### Metrics Identification Process for Visualization
#### Informal Consulation Sessions
Therapeutic needs and system capabilities were defined through _literature review_, _demo/ shadowing sessions_ from collaborating institute on VR equipment and exercise programs, _informal interviews and surveys_ with exercise professionals.

**Participants:**
* 25 exercise professionals from local long-term care faciliteis
* 5 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 3 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering
* 3 consultants (healthcare & VR game development) from collaborating VR game development company

**Results:**
A list of possible outcomes and metrics that can be collected.

#### Ranking survey with semi-structured interview
Due to restricted access to long-term care facilities during COVID-19, additional exercise professionals from local community programs were recrutied to continue investigate user preference and needs. Exercise professional were asked fill out a _survey_ to rank and comment on the identified potential metrics. Afterwards, a _semi-structured group interview_ was carried out to further discuss the results and insights.

**Participants:**
* 4 exercise professionals from local community programs
* 3 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 1 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering

**Results:**
Prioritized list of outcomes and metrics.

### Data Visualization Creation Process
An interative co-design process was carried out with the same exercise professionals from local ocmmunity programs to develop data visualizations. Two _remote semi-structured focus groups_ were used to brainstorm and refine the data visualization concepts.

**Participants:**
* 4 exercise professionals from local community programs
* 3 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 1 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering

#### Brainstorming Workshop
**Goal:**
1. Gain a better understanding of the preferences and expectations of exercise therapists with respect to different data visualization techniques and metrics
2. Collect ideas to generate initial data visualizations for plausible metrics

**Session Struture:**
- Introduction: Demo the VR exergames and review the metrics that can be collected 
- Data visualizations Brainstorming: Data visualization ideation based on sample visualization demonstration (bar chart, table, line chart, etc.).

**Results:**
- Conceptual map representing the feasible metrics and expected features was constructured.
- Four initial data visualizations were proposed.

#### Revision Focus Group
**Goal:**
1. Identify data visualization techniques to be used for the proposed information
2. Discover the design preferences of the data visualization elements
3. Collect novel design ideas for the data visualization concepts

**Session Structure:**
- Introduction: Demo the VR exergames and review the metrics to be used in the session 
- Exploratory activity: Exercise therapists present the way they would visualize the proposed metrics and sample data
- Data visualizations discussions: The four data visualizations created in the previous workshop were presented one at a time to promote discussions through the semi-structured questions 

**Resutls:**
Four data visualizations were revised based on the feedback from the focus group.


### Data Visualization Evaluation Process
**Questions:**
- Likert scale questions: Opinions on presented statements about the data visualizations.
- Slider rating questions: Numerical value (0 to 10) indicating the performance of the proposed data visualizations on different aspects.
- Open-ended questions: Questions collecting preference and suggestions on the proposed data visualizations and probing unique features about each data visualization.

**Results:**
Total 47 valid responses. Analysis in progress.
