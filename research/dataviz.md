## Project Description

Exergames have the potential to collect quantified, objective, and complementary information about the exergaming sessions through the use of motion-based technologies. However, limited research has explored how VR exergames can be used as tools to manage and administer exercise programs using the information collected in exergaming sessions. 

This research explores metrics related to the performance of a person and creates data visualizations for the information collected through Exerfarm Valley, which is a head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR)exergames system developed in part through this thesis work. The data visualizations resulting from this thesis research are intended to be used by exercise professionals in evaluating the client's performance during an exercise program and manage exercise therapy. The identified metrics for representing the player's performance during exergaming sessions could be applied to other exergames, potentially providing useful information about the client's status and exergaming sessions to exercise professionals. To the author's knowledge, this research represents the first data visualisations to be created for HMD-VR exergames through multi-disciplinary collaboration using user-centered design methods.
