# Development of Novel Data Representations for Virtual Reality (VR) Exergames
[UWaterloo ITWIL Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/intelligent-technologies-wellness-independent-living/)| Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 | Role: Graduate Research Student (Master's Thesis)

## Project Description

Exergames have the potential to collect quantified, objective, and complementary information about the exergaming sessions through the use of motion-based technologies. However, limited research has explored how VR exergames can be used as tools to manage and administer exercise programs using the information collected in exergaming sessions. 

The objectives of this project are:
1. Explore metrics related to the performance of a person.
2. Co-create data visualizations for the information collected with exercise therapists.
3. Evaluate the proposed data visualizations on its potential of complementing existing exercise therapy.

## Process
The overall project is devided into three phases:


### Metrics Identification Process for Visualization
In parallel with the development of [VR exergames](/research/vr), the potential metrics representing player's performance were identified through consultation sessions (informal discussions & formal interviews) with exercise therapists.  


### Data Visualization Creation Process

#### Brainstorming Workshop

#### Revision Focus group


### Data Visualization Evaluation Process


## Outcomes 
* ![Distance rowed data visualization](/images/DRDV.png)
* Heart rate and (arm movement) stroke rate data visualization
* Frontal reach and overhead reach data visualization
* 3D motion trajectory during gameplay data visualization 
* [Prilimiary evaluation](ttp://hdl.handle.net/10012/16614) of proposed data visualizations.
