# Development of Novel Data Representations for Virtual Reality (VR) Exergames
[UWaterloo ITWIL Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/intelligent-technologies-wellness-independent-living/)| Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 | Role: Graduate Research Student (Master's Thesis)

## Project Description

Exergames have the potential to collect quantified, objective, and complementary information about the exergaming sessions through the use of motion-based technologies. However, limited research has explored how VR exergames can be used as tools to manage and administer exercise programs using the information collected in exergaming sessions. 

The objectives of this project are:
1. Explore metrics related to the performance of a person.
2. Co-create data visualizations for the information collected with exercise therapists.
3. Evaluate the proposed data visualizations on its potential of complementing existing exercise therapy.

## Contribution
I lead the sessions and data analysis process in this project.

## Process
The overall project is devided into three phases:


### Metrics Identification Process for Visualization
In parallel with the development of [VR exergames](/research/vr), the potential metrics representing player's performance were identified through consultation sessions (informal discussions & survey) with exercise professionals.  

#### Informal Consulation Sessions
**Participants:**
* 5 exercise professionals from local long-term care faciliteis
* 6 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 4 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering
* 3 consultants (healthcare & VR game development) from collaborating company
**Results:**
A list of possible outcomes and metrics that can be collected.

#### Survey
**Participants:**
* 4 exercise professionals from local community programs
* 3 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 2 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering
**Results:**
Prioritized list of outcomes and metrics that can be collected.

### Data Visualization Creation Process

#### Participants
* 4 exercise professionals from local community programs
* 3 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Kinesiology
* 2 researchers from the University of Waterloo, field of Engineering

#### Brainstorming Workshop
**Goal:**
1. Gain a better understanding of the preferences and expectations of exercise therapists with respect to different data visualization techniques and metrics
2. Collect ideas to generate initial data visualizations for plausible metrics

**Session Struture:**
- Introduction: Demo the VR exergames and review the metrics that can be collected 
- Data visualizations Brainstorming: Data visualization ideation based on sample visualization demonstration (bar chart, table, line chart, etc.).
**Results:**
- Conceptual map representing the feasible metrics and expected features was constructured.
- Four initial data visualizations were proposed.

#### Revision Focus Group
**Goal:**
1. Identify data visualization techniques to be used for the proposed information
2. Discover the design preferences of the data visualization elements
3. Collect novel design ideas for the data visualization concepts
**Session Structure:**
- Introduction: Demo the VR exergames and review the metrics to be used in the session 
- Exploratory activity: Exercise therapists present the way they would visualize the proposed metrics and sample data
- Data visualizations discussions: The four data visualizations created in the previous workshop were presented one at a time to promote discussions through the semi-structured questions 

**Resutls:**
Four data visualizations were revised based on the feedback from the focus group.


### Data Visualization Evaluation Process
Through an online questionnaire, the data visualziations are evaluated using a set of likert scale questions, slider rating questions, and open ended quesitons to understand the preferences and suggestions of exercise professionals on the proposed data visualizations. 
**Results:**
Total 47 valid responses. Analysis in progress.
