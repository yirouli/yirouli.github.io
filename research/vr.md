## Project Description

Exercise has been shown to have significant physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits for older adults, however, changing abilities can make it difficult for people living with dementia to engage in exercise. With the [pilot trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G34FasThCgY), we have demonstrated the potential of VR exergames for people living with dementia. Together with therapists, people with early-stage dementia and a VR game development company, we co-creat a set of VR exercise games to encourage engagement in exercise for people living with dementia in long-term care facilities using head-mounted displayed VR headset.
