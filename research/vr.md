# Virtual Reality (VR) Exergames to Promote Physical Actitivity in People Living with Dementia
[UWaterloo ITWIL Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/intelligent-technologies-wellness-independent-living/)| Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 | Role: Graduate Research Student (Student investigator)

## Project Description

Exercise has been shown to have significant physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits for older adults, however, changing abilities can make it difficult for people living with dementia to engage in exercise. With the [pilot trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G34FasThCgY), we have demonstrated the potential of VR exergames for people living with dementia. Together with therapists, people with early-stage dementia and a VR game development company, we co-creat a set of VR exercise games to encourage engagement in exercise for people living with dementia in long-term care facilities using head-mounted displayed VR headset.


## Contribution
I helped structure and carry out the sessions as well as data analysis for game development.

## Outcomes 
* A suite of [VR exergames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UighfmftAWA&t=3s) for people living with dementia.
* [Framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50164-8_9) to design, develop, and evaluation serious games for health.

## Participants
- local long-term care facilities
 - 25 exercise professionals
 - 5 residents living with dementia
- collaborating VR game development company
 - 1 healthcare consultant
 - 2 technical consultants
- University of Waterloo research team
 - 5 researchers from the Department of Kinesiology
 - 3 researchers from the Department of Engineering


### Problem Probing
- A comphrensive _literature review_ on VR exergames for people living with dementia was conducted to identify problem space, understand the existing solutions, and review design guidelines for the target population. 
- Based on the current exercise therapy practice, therapeutic recommendations for exercise prescription, and physical challenges faced by the target population, a list of desired movements and physical fitness goal was defined through multiple _informal interviews_ with collaborating exercise professionals.

### Problem Solving
- 2 types of _brainstorming workshops_ (3 brainstorming sessions in total) were conducted to create paper prototypes and discuss possible game mechanics and scenarios of the VR exergames. 
	- brainstorming workshop
	- 1-on-1 interviews and survey
- 3 types of _semi-structured playtesting interviews_ (6 playtesting sessions in total) were carried out to refine specific elements of the game.
	- 1-on-1 playtesting interviews with residents
	- playtesting focus groups with exercise professionals
	- internal discussions within University of Waterloo
