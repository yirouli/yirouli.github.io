June 2018 - Present | Role: User Experience Consultant

## Responsibilities
**Products**
- Wolfram Cloud
- Wolfram desktop products
	- Wolfram Mathematica
	- Wolfram Desktop
- Wolfram mobile Applications
	- Wolfram Cloud

**Activities**
- Provide clean and annotated wireframes of products features(Axure/Sketch)
	- Identify user stories
	- Document workflow and potential edge cases
	- Provide (interactive) propotypes
- Research and audit
	- Existing products to identify usability issues
	- Current practice and trends on the market using competitive products
	- Design guidelines for different operating systems
- Communication
	- Iterate proposal with development team and design team
	- Present deliverables to various stakeholders
	- User interviews


## Sample Projects

### Desktop Products --- Email to... 
**Project Description:** 
A new menu item that allows user sending the current working (potentially unsaved) file, similar to existing feature in Wolfram Cloud.
The **_goal_** of this project was to:
1. Identify dialog states relating to different user scenarios
2. Provide interface proposal and specs based on existing features in Wolfram Cloud 

**Process:**
<p>
_Problem Scoping:_ Through 1 kickoff meeting with development team, the project scope and capabilities were specified. 
</p>
<p>
User scenarios were generated based on the function and flow:
- User wants to send the file as an attachment
	- File is attached and sent
	- File is too large to be sent as an attachment
- User wants to send the file via Cloud
	- User has not signed into Wolfram Cloud
	- User has signed into Wolfram Cloud and file is sent
	- File is too large to be sent via Cloud
</p>
<p>
_Research:_
- Investigated existing "send to" dialog in Wolfram Cloud
- Reviewed "email to" functionalities in competitive products
</p>
<p>
_Solution Proposal:_ Through 2 interative discussion meetings with development team, the wireframe was finalized.
</p>

### Wolfram Cloud --- Notify users with limited permissions
**Project Description:** For interactive objects, such as [3D graphics](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graphics3D.html) or [manipulations](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Manipulate.html?q=Manipulate), user need to be given proper permissions to interact when viewing other's notebook. 
The **_goal_** of this project was to: Notify user that they lack of permissions for interative actions.

**Process:**
<p>
_Problem Scoping:_ Through 2 kickoff meetings with development team, the project scope and user issue were specified. 
</p>
<p>
_Research:_
- Investigated existing error cases and notification type in Wolfram Cloud
- Identify different user situations:
	- Cache of the interactive content is available
	- Cache of the interactive content is not available
</p>
<p>
_Solution Proposal:_ Through 2 interative discussion meetings with development team, the wireframe was finalized and sent to design.

<!-- ## User Experience Improvement Processes

### Identify Problems
Depending on the feature and the products, different method will be used.
- User interviews
	- Semi-structured: Shadow specific user workflows and probe questions.
	- Unstructured: Document user questions while exploring user interfaces.
- Technical meetings with development team
	- Understand technical capabilities and limitations
	- Identify user stories and special cases


### Propose Solution
- Solution mechanics
	- What others do
 	- Exisiting feastures
- Solution workflows
 	- Event/Action
	- Environment states
 	- Responsive behavior
